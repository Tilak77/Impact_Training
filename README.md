# Java Programs Collection

This repository contains a variety of beginner-to-intermediate level Java programs, each demonstrating a specific concept, algorithm, or problem-solving technique. The code is organized as individual `.java` files, each with a clear and focused purpose. Below is a summary of the main files and their functionality:

- **RootOfQuadEqn.java**: Solves a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
- **ToggleNthBit.java**: Toggles the nth bit of a number.

## Miscellaneous
- **AtmMachineFunction.java**: Simulates basic ATM operations (incomplete).
- **RotateArrayFormNthPosition.java**: (Incorrect code) Intended to rotate an array from the nth position.
- **SwitchCase.java**: Demonstrates the use of switch-case statements.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile any `.java` file using:
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class using:
   ```sh
   java FileName
   ```
   (Do not include the `.java` extension when running.)

Some programs require user input. Follow the prompts in the terminal when running those programs.

## Notes
- Some files may contain incomplete or incorrect code, as they are intended for learning and experimentation.
- The `Bitwise Operators` folder contains bitwise manipulation examples.
- For any questions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
